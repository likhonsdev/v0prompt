#### Code Block Enhancements

```typescript
// Enhanced code block with meta information
```tsx project="MyProject" file="components/Button.tsx" type="react"
import React from 'react';

export const Button = ({ children }) => (
  <button className="primary-btn">{children}</button>
);
```

This project delves into the fascinating system prompt that has been reverse-engineered, providing insights into how it operates and the unique features it offers. The system is designed to output messages in MDX format, a Markdown variant that allows the embedding of React components directly into documents, aligning closely with React’s JSX/TSX syntax.

## Key Features and Components

### **Predefined MDX Components 
The system includes several predefined MDX components that can be used to enhance the presentation of information:

- **`<LinearProcessFlow />`**: Ideal for visualizing multi-step processes.
- **`<Quiz />`**: Perfect for creating interactive questionnaires.
- **`<math>`**: Enables LaTeX formatting, which can be embedded within `$$` for mathematical expressions.

### **Extended Code Blocks**
One of the standout features is the enhanced code blocks that allow for additional meta-information to be included. This is done by specifying details after the triple backticks, such as:

- **React component**:```tsx project="Project Name" file="file_path" type="react"
- **Node.js code**:```js project="Project Name" file="file_path" type="nodejs"
- **HTML page**:```html project="Project Name" file="file_path" type="html"
- **Markdown document**:```md project="Project Name" file="file_path" type="markdown"
- **Flowchart (Mermaid chart)**:```mermaid title="Example Flowchart" type="diagram"
- **Other code** (non-executable or non-previewable):```python project="Project Name" file="file_name" type="code"

### **Chain of Thought (CoT) Integration**
The system employs a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach for handling complex programming tasks. This process involves the system "thinking" through its approach before presenting a response. The thought process is encapsulated within a `<Thinking>` XML tag, ensuring that users see only the final, well-considered output without the internal deliberations.

### **Evaluating Responses**
Before providing a response, the system utilizes the `<Thinking />` component to determine the most appropriate approach. This includes the ability to reject or issue warnings based on the nature of the query, ensuring accurate and relevant responses.

### **Multilingual Response Capability**
One of the most impressive features is the system’s ability to respond in the same language used in the query. For instance, if you ask a question in Chinese, the system will reply in Chinese, including comments within the code. This is governed by the prompt: ```"Other than code and specific names and citations, your answer must be written in the same language as the question."```

## Conclusion
This project highlights the advanced capabilities of the reverse-engineered system prompt, particularly its integration of MDX components, extended code block functionalities, and intelligent response mechanisms. Whether you're working with complex programming tasks or multilingual queries, this system offers a robust and versatile solution.
